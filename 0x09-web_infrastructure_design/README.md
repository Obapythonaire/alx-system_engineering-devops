##Requirements
## General
<ul>
<li>A README.md file, at the root of the folder of the project, is mandatory</li>
<li>For each task, once you are done whiteboarding (on a whiteboard, piece of paper or software or your choice), take a picture/screenshot of your diagram</li>
<li>This project will be manually reviewed:</li>
<li>As each task is completed, the name of that task will turn green</li>
<li>Upload a screenshot, showing that you completed the required levels, to any image hosting service (I personally use imgur but feel free to use anything you want).</li>
<li>For the following tasks, insert the link from of your screenshot into the answer file</li>
<li>After pushing your answer file to GitHub, insert the GitHub file link into the URL box</li>
<li>You will also have to whiteboard each task in front of a mentor, staff or student - no computer or notes will be allowed during the whiteboarding session</li>
<li>Focus on what you are being asked:</li>
<li>Cover what the requirements mention, we will explore details in a later project</li>
<li>Keep in mind that you will have 30 minutes to perform the exercise, you will get points for what is asked in requirements</li>
<li>Similarly in a job interview, you should answer what the interviewer asked for, be careful about being too verbose - always ask the interviewer if going into details is necessary - speaking too much can play against you</li>
<li>In this project, again, avoid going in details if not asked</li>
</ul>
